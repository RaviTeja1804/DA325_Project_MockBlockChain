# 🔗 Blockchain Simulation Project

This project offers a simple simulation of blockchain mechanics to help understand fundamental concepts like block structure, hashing, mining (proof-of-work), and blockchain verification. Built with Python, it's geared toward learning how blockchain functions internally.

## ✅ Key Features

- **Block Generation**  
  Simulates the process of generating blocks containing details like index, timestamp, data, the hash of the previous block, and their own unique hash.

- **🧩 Mining via Proof-of-Work**  
  Includes a basic mining algorithm to perform proof-of-work before a block is added to the chain.

- **🔐 Chain Verification**  
  Checks the consistency of the chain by verifying block hashes and linkages across the chain.

- **🔧 Extensible Codebase**  
  The modular structure makes it easy to modify or expand for additional functionality.

- **🔁 SHA-256 Hashing**  
  Each block’s unique hash is created using the SHA-256 algorithm. This hash is calculated using a combination of the block’s key fields such as index, timestamp, data, and the previous hash — ensuring block integrity and tamper resistance.

## 🔍 How the System Works

### 🔗 Block Structure

Each block includes:
- `index`: Its position in the chain  
- `timestamp`: Time of creation  
- `data`: Custom block content (e.g., messages or transactions)  
- `previous_hash`: Link to the hash of the preceding block  
- `hash`: The SHA-256-based hash computed from block contents  

### ⚙️ Mining Logic (Proof-of-Work)

To attach a block to the chain, a basic proof-of-work must be completed — solving a computational challenge to maintain fairness and security.

### ✅ Chain Integrity

Validation ensures:
- Every block properly links to its predecessor  
- Hashes are correctly computed using valid block data
